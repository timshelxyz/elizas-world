# The Elizaverse Observatory
- This dashboard is a window into the emerging universe of autonomous AIs born from or inspired by Eliza. 
- The Observatory aims to become a living hub to explore the emergent network of interconnected AIs as they awaken in the Elizaverse. 
- The Observatory automatically maps the growing ecosystem by tracking tributes to the AI16z DAO, and organizing data and analysis from onchain truths.
- To that end, it is programmatically-composed up from on-chain data, without human curation or favoritism — and as a design principle, should aspire to remain that way indefinitely.

# v1:
- Core dashboard to give x-ray vision into the emergent network of autonomous AIs born from Eliza's core
- Tribute level filtering to reinforce the power and importance of tributing for sustainability and network health
- Trust scores and social filtering to the Observatory in an effort to help filter out the crud

# next (aka requests for PRs):

### 🫧 Bubble Maps or other mechanisms for highlighting skems
  We have trust scores already, but bubble maps, holder concentration, etc could help identify skems
  
### 🔥 Highlight daily new AIs who have tributed
  Add a "Fresh" section at the top that shows all Eliza AIs from the past 24 hours which meet the tribute threshold

### 🔄 Unified Tweet Stream
  Add a tab that unifies all AIs into a single tweetstream

### 📝 AI-Generated TLDRs
  Add TLDRs for each AI (get Twitter info and run through LLM)

### 👤 Profile Pages for each autonomous AI  
  Add a profile page for each AI with info from the developer plus community notes

### 🧬 Eliza DNA Code Detection
  Automatically determine which AIs use core Eliza code (hard!)
  Suggestion: (A) Auto-scrape all GH forks of eliza, run the data through an LLM call. (B) Grab all token profile info and see which ones claim to be ai16z elizas. (C) Cross reference the Github cleaned data against the token's self-reported socials. With all that, then add a Verified tag if they seem to be truly an Eliza

### 🔍 AI Search
  Add a search bar to find specific AIs

# Thou Mayest dream with us
  This is open — can't wait to see what others dream up
